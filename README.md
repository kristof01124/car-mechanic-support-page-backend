# car-mechanic-support-page-backend

This repository is the backend for the [front-end car-mechanic page of the same name](https://github.com/kristof01124/car-mechanic-support-page-frontend).
It's hard to say anything concrete about it so far, we only know that we will use the Java Spring framework,
have some sort of a database, and have the entire thing run in Docker.

***HOW TO USE:***
Execute the following command while in root directory:
`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

The application will start at `http://localhost:8080`. 
You can test any functions using Postman or a similar program.
`Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop execution.
